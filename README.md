# Poll Widget Demo


* Clone or copy the directory on your machine.
* Open folder in VSCode 
* if you do not have live server extension installed , install it
* Click on "Go live" to view the served site.

* Everytime the widget/react code is changed, a production build needs to be build and the "static" folder needs to be copied here. The 3 file names i.e. the css and the last two .js files should match with the file names in the static folder.

* Working : There are two poll questions configured , whichever page loads first they get a poll each , the third page does not get any poll. The entire poll object is stored in the localstorage.

* optimization :  There is a way to overcome the above issue of renaming files on every build by overriding configurations in the webpack 

* optimization : The widget can be further beautified/ animated etc... with images/svg's etc.. and css.
